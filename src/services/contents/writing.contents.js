Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to the Sun and the biggest in our Solar System. The gas giant has about one-thousandth of the Sun's mass but is still heavier than all other planets combined.

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun. It may be less than one-thousandth as massive as our parent star, but it outweighs all other Solar System objects combined. Jupiter is a bright object in the sky that can be readily seen by anyone with normal vision at night. Jupiter is sometimes referred to as a "gas giant" because it is made primarily of gaseous and liquid matter, rather than solid matter. Jupiter's atmosphere is composed of about 88 percent hydrogen and 12 percent helium by percent volume of gas molecules, and trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and "smoke"-like particles of unknown composition. There are also traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur.
